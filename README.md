# LeetCode Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my **LeetCode Challenge Repository**!  

This repository contains my **DSA problem-solving journey** where I upload my **solutions to LeetCode problems**. Each solution is organized, explained, and focused on clarity and learning.  

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

I created this repo to:  
- Maintain a **daily coding streak** on GitHub and LeetCode.  
- Organize my solutions by **difficulty** (Easy, Medium, Hard) and **patterns**.  
- Build a **clear and professional portfolio** of my problem-solving skills.  
- Track and reinforce my understanding of **DSA concepts** over time.

---

## 🧠 Why I’m Doing This

I believe that **consistency is the key to mastery**. By uploading my solutions:  
- I strengthen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.  
- I systematically practice a variety of problems.  
- I prepare myself for technical interviews in a structured way.  
- I turn daily problem-solving into a **long-term habit of learning and improvement**.

## 🔗 My Recommended Practice: Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet

I follow the **Striver A2Z DSA Sheet**, which provides a **complete roadmap to mastering DSA concepts**:  

[Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/dsa/strivers-a2z-sheet-learn-dsa-a-to-z)

> This sheet helps me **systematically cover important patterns and problems** from basic to advanced.  
> Following this sheet ensures that I am well-prepared for coding interviews and competitive programming.

## 💻 Daily Practice Workflow

1. I will solve a problem on **LeetCode**.  
2. I Write a **well-explained solution** in the corresponding folder.  
3. I Update the **daily log** in this README or in `Problem_of_the_day`.  
4. Commit and push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Day 1: Solved LeetCode #1 Two Sum"
   git push
   
## 🌟 Motivation

- I code **every day** to improve my skills and stay consistent.  
- I organize my solutions so that they are **easy to read and revise**.  
- Every problem I solve strengthens my problem-solving abilities and confidence.  
- I embrace challenges and learn from mistakes, knowing that every problem solved is **a step forward**.  

> “I code consistently, I learn continuously, and I grow every day.”
